00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,830
It's nothing extraordinary.
Just the record of a girl
chosen by a peculiar disease.

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,684
In the human brain there are about
140 billion neurons and

3
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:24,989
10 times more cells,

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,919
which give orders to those neurons.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,759
They're divided into 2 groups:

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,680
Central nervous system
and peripheral nervous system.

7
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:39,464
The central nervous system consists of the
brain, brain stem, cerebellum,

8
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:42,842
spinal cord and spinal column.

9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,444
Allowing the body to
move freely and agilely,

10
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:53,550
are the cerebellum, the
brain stem, and the spine.

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,519
Mrs. Ikeuchi,

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,619
this is an image of your daughter's brain.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,360
If you compare it with that of a normal brain,

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,934
you will see that the cerebellum is shriveled.

15
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:12,799
Your daughters disease,

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,409
is caused by deterioration of the cerebellum,

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,414
which causes the neurons there
to begin to disappear.

18
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:27,414
In other words, it's as if they
are beginning to break.

19
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:29,179
Break?

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,089
Initially there are no specific symptoms,

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,490
but you may begin to notice an instability walking.

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,810
A person will fall more often,
or have a difficulty calculating distances.

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,193
Perhaps having trouble writing clearly.

24
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:16,030
Why was I chosen to have this disease?

25
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,740
It will become difficult to speak.

26
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,590
Mom, what is the purpose of me living?

27
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,960
The symptoms start slowly,
but will undoubtedly progress.

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:58,170
Thinking of the future brings even more tears.

29
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:19,163

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,839
Thank you for this morning!
Thanks to you...

184
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,274
It's all your fault I had to take the test.

185
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,661
Eh?

186
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,470
Who is she?

187
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:42,310
I don't know.

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,580
Haruto!

189
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,924
You rode a bike with a boy?

190
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:52,490
Were you late?

191
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,259
Who is this guy?
Where is he from?

192
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,964
She's fine, isn't she?

193
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:59,024
He just helped her get there on time.

194
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,176
Is he a boy you can't even tell us about?

195
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:03,294
But I only managed to finish about half the test.

196
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:04,799
Can I have more?

197
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,554
Rika eat your carrots.

198
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:08,239
Isn't anyone listening to me?

199
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,259
Dad you spit everywhere, that's disgusting!

200
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,969
How dare call your parents disgusting!

201
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,609
Disgusting is disgusting!

202
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,820
We should thank this guy for giving you a ride.

203
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,890
What? Thank him?

204
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,389
What are you thinking?

205
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,564
How can you allow a girl her age
to get on a bike with a boy?

206
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:34,334
It is not a question of age, right?
The problem is her cycling with a boy.

207
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:36,999
Well, look...

208
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,664
I hope you both passed.

209
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,269
What am I gonna do if I didn't?

210
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,774
It'll be fine.
Damn, it fell...

211
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:48,180
Oh... damn, it...
I mean, it just slipped out!

212
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,784
-- My number! My number!
-- Mine too!

213
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,094
Thank God! We did it!

214
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,529
Ikeuchi!

215
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,130
Kawamoto.

216
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,100
You both got in. Congratulations!

217
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,329
Thank you!

218
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,524
They were on my basketball
team in middle school.

219
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,074
This is Takeda, from my new team.

220
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,544
It's nice to meet you!

221
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,539
Our pleasure.

222
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,774
Ikeuchi, you're going to keep playing
in high school, right?

223
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:23,950
We will.

224
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,949
I'm glad.

225
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,449
Our team is pretty strict, so make
sure you prepare yourselves.

226
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,549
Of course.

227
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,190
Well then, I'll see you there.

228
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,164
He said "I'm glad."

229
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,509
Cut it out.

230
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,964
You've had a crush on him since we were 11...

231
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:45,299
Why not tell him?

232
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,239
No way! That's impossible!

233
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,104
Then should I tell him for you?

234
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:53,806
No! Don't you dare!

235
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:56,286
Come on, It's irritating watching you wait around.

236
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,835
Don't be angry.

237
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:01,079
I'm not angry, but...

238
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,224
By the way, the guy who helped
you on the day of the test...

239
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,190
did he get in?

240
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,066
[Closed in celebration of exams.
Will reopen as usual tomorrow.
-Ikeuchi Tofu Shop.]

241
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,464
Congratulations!

242
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:17,669
Thank you!

243
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,469
Well done!

244
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,774
-- As expected of my daughter.
-- Dad, you didn't go to Higashi.

245
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,010
Why do you always say such unnecessary things?

246
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,044
Shall we eat?

247
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,711
Bon appetit!

248
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,309
Thank you for the food.

249
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,244
-- What is it?
-- Aya, congratulations!

250
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:36,549
Thank you!

251
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,584
Aya, this is for you.

252
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:42,359
Eh? Really?
Thank you!

253
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,329
Don't bother saying thank you.

254
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,457
There's no way you're
happy to get that.

255
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,239
I am!
It's Hiro's treasure, right?

256
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,169
-- Just like an honor student.
-- Stop it already.

257
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,804
What are you giving her, Ako?

258
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,269
I can't give her anything.

259
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,554
I can't even buy the clothes I want.

260
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:01,544
Can I have some more?

261
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:02,610
Here.

262
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,949
Anyways,

263
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,454
you guys just keep going
on about Higashi.

264
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,620
It's stupid.

265
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,930
This is a gift from your father.
Ta-dan!

266
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,764
Thanks Dad!

267
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:25,699
I made it myself.

268
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,369
-- Really?
-- He's lying!

269
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,404
Your father used to work at a watch shop.

270
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:34,080
He says that's where
he learned how to make it.

271
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,150
I have something special for Ako too.

272
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,450
Ta-dan!

273
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,189
What is that?

274
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,349
It's cute, isn't it?

275
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,424
I also worked in a tailoring.

276
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:52,429
You've done so many things, Dad.

277
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,764
That just means nothing you did lasted long.

278
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:55,399
What did you say?

279
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,269
I only changed jobs

280
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,869
to find what suited me best.

281
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,639
-- You make it sound so beautiful, eh?
-- But after

282
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,774
so many different jobs he decided
to manage this store

283
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,944
and make tofu. Isn't that great?

284
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,049
I agree!

285
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,814
Come on, let's see how it looks!

286
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:13,880
What?

287
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,449
Oh, it looks great on you!

288
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,554
Like I'd ever wear something
so out of fashion!

289
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:20,199
Out of fashion?

290
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,694
-- Just wear it at home then.
-- In the house?

291
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,354
-- Or to sleep.
-- To sleep?

292
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:24,564
Or under a sweater.

293
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,490
Under a sweater?

294
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,864
Is it that bad?

295
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:28,629
Hey Mom!

296
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,764
Since we're celebrating
my admission to school

297
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:33,670
we should let dad have some beer!

298
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,204
Please, just one bottle!

299
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:37,206
I guess it can't be helped.

300
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:38,139
Really?

301
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,314
Of course!
I'll get it.

302
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm so happy!

303
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,914
Here, Dad.

304
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:48,079
Thank you!

305
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,024
My first beer in so long,
all thanks to Aya.

306
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,790
How wonderful!

307
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,324
What are you doing?

308
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,189
Sorry!

309
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,264
My first beer after so long...

310
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:05,934
That was careless of me!
Sorry!

311
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,971
Don't worry.

312
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,990
On no! I used this to clean it.

313
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,040
Ako's shirt...

314
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,419
What are you doing with the lights off?

315
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,864
Sorry I'm late, we had a
last minute meeting.

316
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:34,920
Congratulations on the exam.

317
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,109
Thank you.

318
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,067
Now you can follow in
my and Keisuke's footsteps.

319
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:44,644
You should be a little more happy.

320
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,679
You're such a strange boy.

321
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,444
You know, he didn't even go to see the results.

322
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:50,510
No?

323
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,754
His professor contacted us to let us know.

324
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,419
Worried you wouldn't get in?

325
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,490
Well, let's go get ready for dinner.

326
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,400
I must be tired.

327
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,820
[Admission Ceremony]

328
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,153
Ta-dan!
How's it look?

329
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,083
You look great!

330
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,799
-- Really?
-- It looks great!

331
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,369
I want to wear it too!

332
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,174
Then all of us have to go to
the same high school.

333
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:26,779
No thanks.

334
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,114
With my grades,
I could never get into Higashi.

335
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,249
Yes you could!

336
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,084
I don't want to anyways.

337
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,950
Thank you for the food.

338
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,989
I'm sorry we can't go to the ceremony.

339
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,454
It's okay, you have work to do.
It can't be helped.

340
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:45,489
Alright, I'm ready!

341
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,234
-- Why are you dressed like that?
-- For the admission ceremony, of course.

342
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,969
What about the shop?

343
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,669
We'll reopen it this afternoon.

344
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,074
What kind of tofu shop
is only open in the afternoon?

345
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,769
But...

346
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,879
Hey dad, let's take a picture.

347
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,419
Okay. Here we go.
Now smile!

348
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,924
Change poses. Beautiful!

349
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:14,019
Now come over here!

350
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,420
-- Mom, you come too.
-- Yes, yes!

351
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,764
Hey, you've lose weight, haven't you?

352
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,029
You think?

353
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,364
You aren't on some strange diet, are you?

354
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:25,170
Of course not.

355
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,674
You have to be sure to take good care of yourself.

356
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,670
I know.

357
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,340
Let's take another. Come on everyone.

358
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,239
I'll pass.

359
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,350
No, no.  Join us.

360
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,449
Wait a minute... Okay, here we go.

361
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,920
Make room for me. Smile!

362
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,199
Alright.

363
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,584
See you later.

364
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:03,000
Be careful.

365
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,380
That's why I said be careful.

366
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:18,591
[Meiwadai Higashi High School
2005 Admission Ceremony]

367
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,394
I'm your supervisor Nishino.

368
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:22,359
I'll be your English professor,

369
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,509
and an assistant for
the female basketball team.

370
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,589
I hope that for this year...

371
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,634
Everyone here seems so intelligent, don't they?

372
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,716
It's going to be hard to keep up!

373
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:33,208
I'll start by taking roll.

374
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,670
Asou Haruto.

375
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,210
Asou?

376
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,410
Asou Haruto?

377
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,549
-- Onda!
-- Yes!

378
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,454
You and Asou went to the same school, right?
Have you heard anything?

379
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,720
No.

380
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,729
You're late Haruto!

381
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,664
It's the day of the ceremony and
you show up late?

382
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,429
Excuse me.

383
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,764
While I was on my way, I saw
a girl fall and hurt herself.

384
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:04,064
I couldn't just leave her, so
I brought her to hospital.

385
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,800
You never fail to find trouble, do you?

386
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,640
Well then, sit down.

387
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,810
That's the guy from the day of the test, right?

388
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,150
Kouhei Onda.

389
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,010
Akihiro Okada.

390
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,484
Hey, was that true?

391
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:25,656
No.

392
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,060
I knew it!

393
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,859
What a strange guy.

394
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,094
Now, it's time to decide
the class representatives.

395
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,600
Would anyone like to volunteer?

396
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,430
Well then, are there any suggestions?

397
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,369
Okay, then for the first semester,

398
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,114
the task will belong to
the first people in the registry.

399
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:49,474
-- For the boys, Asou.
-- What, are you kidding?

400
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:51,149
For the girls, Ikeuchi.

401
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,380
Are these two okay?

402
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,054
Well, then please do a good job.

403
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:02,189
-- Yes!
-- What a pain!

404
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,390
Representatives, please come to the front!

405
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,234
I think you've already been informed
of the singing contest this June.

406
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,269
It's one of the traditions of Higashi.

407
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,004
So that new students can cooperate

408
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:18,421
and be united as a class.

409
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,774
First of all we must decide on a
music director and conductor.

410
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:24,740
Representatives, please proceed with the debate.

411
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,550
Um...

412
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,064
Well, first of all, we should choose
an orchestra director.

413
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:41,334
I think the class representatives should do it.

414
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:42,394
In that case, you go ahead!

415
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:43,670
Eh?

416
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,569
We'll vote.

417
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,774
So, for the director...
What was your name, again?

418
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,509
Ikeuchi.

419
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,610
Is anyone opposed to Ikeuchi?

420
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,749
Then it's decided.

421
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,219
-- Wait...
-- Now we have to think of a song.

422
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,650
I think that should be
decided by our representatives too.

423
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,684
You were chosen as a class representative?

424
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:06,449
That's amazing!

425
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,859
As expected of my daughter!

426
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,124
Dad, you weren't class representative, were you?

427
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,176
Well, no.

428
00:27:11,177 --> 00:27:12,159
Of course.

429
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,034
But the other representative is useless!

430
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:19,104
Oh, it's the guy who gave me a
ride the day of the test.

431
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,904
The one with the bike?

432
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,669
You are in the same class?

433
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,079
You should bring him over sometime.

434
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,264
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

435
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:31,379
We'll treat him to some tofu!

436
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,214
-- But weren't you against him the other day?
-- If it weren't for him

437
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:39,289
Aya wouldn't have gotten into Higashi.

438
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:44,094
He kind of forced me to accept the
role of director of orchestra.

439
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,294
What? What? What?

440
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:47,859
Really?

441
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,704
My daughter, leading a team
in front of an audience?

442
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,704
I want to come and see!

443
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:52,586
Rika too!

444
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,700
Me too!

445
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,389
Aya, you're so clumsy!

446
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,310
I really am! Even you're better than me.

447
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,523
A competitive singing group, eh?

448
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,750
Hospital?

449
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,859
I'm just a little bit worried.

450
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,394
You've been dropping things
a lot lately, right?

451
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:21,694
You've been falling down more often too...

452
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:25,834
It's probably just because I'm tired.

453
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:27,239
But still...

454
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,739
Come on mom, don't scare me!

455
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,144
It's frightening to have a mother in
health care say things like that!

456
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:35,414
I'm not trying to scare you, but...

457
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:37,079
Well if you're that worried,

458
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,479
I'll make a trip to the hospital for your sake.

459
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,334
Really? Let's do that.
That way I won't have to worry.

460
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:48,220
I'm fine. I'm only 15.

461
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,024
I'm done in the bathroom.

462
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,064
Aya, go take a bath.

463
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,090
Ok.

464
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,610
-- Um... You're Tomita, right?
-- What is it?

465
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,774
I was hoping you'd help me
with the singing competition?

466
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:11,449
Have someone else do it.

467
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,654
You're the only one in our
class who can play the piano.

468
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:17,089
The class representatives should do it.

469
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:23,780
Your social status will go up if one of you
directs and the other plays the piano.

470
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,769
First year students, welcome!

471
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,729
I'm your manager, Nishino.

472
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,574
I'm Kaori Honda, the team leader.
It's nice to meet you.

473
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,940
Nice to meet you!

474
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:41,174
First of all, let's see what you can do.

475
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,009
Yes!

476
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,150
Line up one at a time, like your classmates.

477
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,520
Yes.

478
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,190
The third year girls will demonstrate first.

479
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,160
Aya, look.

480
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,540
Kawamoto's so cool, isn't he?

481
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,340
Um... we're in the same class, right?

482
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,569
I'm Matsumura Saki.

483
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,120
Ah! The girl with glasses.

484
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,854
This is my first time playing basketball.

485
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:27,820
-- Next.
-- Yes!

486
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,944
Why the biology club?

487
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:47,019
If you want to get girls,
shouldn't you try music or soccer?

488
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,020
I'm not trying to get girls.

489
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:51,544
What about joining...

490
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,884
The biology club.

491
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,879
Why?

492
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,984
I hear the president is beautiful.

493
00:30:57,985 --> 00:30:59,150
Really?

494
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,529
You're from our class.

495
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,564
Yes. My name is Nakahara Keita.

496
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,181
Where's the president?

497
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:11,830
-- You want to join?
-- Yes!

498
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,040
I'm Yoshikawa, the president.

499
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,010
Welcome to the biology club.

500
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,334
Why didn't you wake me?

501
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:27,154
I tried to, over and over!

502
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:28,086
No way!

503
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:28,949
I did.

504
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,789
You didn't want to get up.

505
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,324
Be sure to eat before you go.

506
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:33,760
I'll be fine.

507
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,189
You're taking it too lightly.

508
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,029
When your sister got into her second year...

509
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,834
I'm not like her. I can't do anything right.

510
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,569
Why do you always say that!

511
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,004
Who cares? You're the good girl.

512
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,904
If only you weren't around...!

513
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:50,170
Ako, wait!

514
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,740
What was that about?

515
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,379
Dad, I'm leaving.

516
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,910
See you later.
Be careful!

517
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,190
Aya?

518
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Hey, Shioka!

519
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,189
Aya, Aya...

520
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,160
What happened?
Are you okay?

521
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,399
Shioka!

522
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,830
Calm down. Are you okay?

523
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,980
Call an ambulance!

524
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,674
I'll bring her to the hospital.

525
00:32:26,675 --> 00:32:27,799
I'll go too.

526
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,680
Let me see your towel!

527
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,850
Press this against it.

528
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,476
Can you stand up?

529
00:32:35,477 --> 00:32:37,009
Are you okay?

530
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:39,062
You'll be alright.

531
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,800
Get in.

532
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,169
You have a delivery to make, right dear?

533
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,174
If you come with us, you won't make it in time.

534
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,409
But...

535
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,444
Take care of Rika.
I'll call you in a bit.

536
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:02,980
I'll leave it up to you then.

537
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,080
Drive carefully!

538
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,030
Can you get out?

539
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,464
Oh, good morning.

540
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:41,979
What a surprise!

541
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,824
I was asked to bring this here.

542
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:46,120
Professor Asou.

543
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,990
Your son is here.

544
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,929
Thank you.

545
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,334
It's the speech for today's meeting.

546
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:57,630
It was careless of me to forget it.

547
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,674
Can you still get to school on time?

548
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,740
Yes. I'll see you later.

549
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,210
Haruto...

550
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:14,477
Thank you, you really helped me out.

551
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,130
Asou?

552
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,569
What did you do to your face?

553
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,279
I fell.

554
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,280
You fall an awful lot, don't you?

555
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,220
What about you? Are you sick?

556
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,760
They say... I don't have much time left.

557
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,464
Apparently it progresses rapidly...

558
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:03,800
You can't mean...

559
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,499
I'm kidding.

560
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,600
Eh?

561
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,404
I have athlete's foot.

562
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:09,134
That's disgusting.

563
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:09,971
I'm kidding.

564
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:11,140
Eh?

565
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,540
Hi.

566
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,280
Someone you know?

567
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,919
She's my ex.

568
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,654
Eh? She's so much older than you are.

569
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,150
-- I'm kidding.
-- Eh?

570
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,554
I hear you got into Higashi.

571
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:30,630
Congratulations.

572
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,474
My father is one of the doctors who work here.

573
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,061
You're lying again, right?

574
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,680
Right. You figured it out.

575
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,009
There are no fractures.

576
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,280
It should heal in about a week.

577
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,719
Doctor,

578
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,020
There's something that's been bothering me...

579
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,349
Usually when a person falls,

580
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,800
they'll put their hands out to stop it, right?

581
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,030
Yes.

582
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,534
My daughter's hands weren't scratched at all.

583
00:36:14,535 --> 00:36:17,940
She landed directly on her face.

584
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,040
That's strange, isn't it?

585
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,609
Also,

586
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,884
she's been dropping things a lot lately,

587
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:33,289
and has been having trouble using chopsticks.

588
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,630
[Dr. Hiroshi Mizuno]

589
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,700
I'll see you later.

590
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,089
Think of a song for the competition, ok?

591
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:51,744
You decide.
Anything is fine.

592
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:53,479
No. There has to be something...

593
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,644
Do we want a cheerful song?
One with a specific theme?

594
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:58,479
It doesn't matter.

595
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,054
I won't like anything.

596
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,079
Eh?

597
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,824
I'm telling you, anything is fine.

598
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:05,350
I won't complain.

599
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,204
Humans are greedy, don't you think?

600
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:20,030
In what sense?

601
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:27,914
Plants and animals are content with the
world from the time they're born.

602
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,624
Humans are the only creature

603
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:33,086
that try to force life to continue.

604
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,620
He really is strange...

605
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,820
Aya!

606
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,290
Mom?

607
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,590
Before we go home, let's have them do a check up.

608
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,230
Check up?

609
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,740
Why isn't she calling?

610
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,350
I'm Mizuno, the neurologist.

611
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,920
Thank you for taking care of me.

612
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,560
When did you first start having problems walking?

613
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,229
About a month ago I think,

614
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,394
but I believe it's just because
I haven't gotten enough sleep.

615
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:24,100
What about falling down?

616
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,634
The first time was the day of my entry test.

617
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:32,709
But it was because I was in a hurry.

618
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,640
Have you ever found it difficult to speak?

619
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,000
A little more quickly.

620
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,529
Hello?

621
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,070
I... Well...

622
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,762
How's Aya?

623
00:39:35,763 --> 00:39:38,080
How bad is the wound?
Will it heal?

624
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,090
It won't scar, will it?

625
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:41,779
No, she'll be fine.

626
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,269
They said it should heal without any problems.

627
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,080
Really?  Oh, good!
Thank God!

628
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,054
-- Anyways... About Aya...
-- Oh, you know...

629
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:55,989
I couldn't relax all day.

630
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,678
I was afraid she'd have a scar on her face.

631
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,433
That would have been so heart breaking for her.

632
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:06,099
You don't have to worry about that, but...

633
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,204
Really? Oh good, I'm so glad.

634
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,740
Thanks Shioka.

635
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,474
Anyways... We'll be home soon.

636
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:18,950
Okay, be careful.  I'll see you then.

637
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,060
Excuse us.

638
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,634
We'll let you know the results in a few days.

639
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:43,544
Thank you.

640
00:40:43,545 --> 00:40:45,409
Um...

641
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,479
Is something wrong with me, doctor?

642
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,814
If you notice anything unusual in
your physical behavior,

643
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:55,454
I'd like you to write it down for me.

644
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,549
Okay.

645
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,094
Don't over think it.
Just look at it as a diary.

646
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:03,160
A diary?

647
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,704
How could you trip and
hurt your chin that badly?

648
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:14,570
I know. I'm so clumsy.

649
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,454
Can I come in?

650
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:33,720
Dad?

651
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,464
How's your chin?
Does it hurt?

652
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,199
A little.

653
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,534
I can't believe it kept me
from going to school though.

654
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:47,674
Most people would be happy to skip school.

655
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:50,744
That's true! We're alike after all, eh?

656
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:51,810
Shut up!

657
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,009
Anyways,

658
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,844
you should get some rest.

659
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:58,210
Eh?

660
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,219
Studying is important of course,

661
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,442
but there are more important things.

662
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:09,069
The important thing is to know your limits.

663
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,923
Limits?

664
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,211
Not really limits.
You just need to find a good balance.

665
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,092
I see.

666
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,060
I guess you're right.

667
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,950
Yes.

668
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,847
Since Professor Tanaka is out today,

669
00:42:57,848 --> 00:42:59,569
use this time for self study.

670
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:04,110
Representatives, have you chosen
a song for the competition?

671
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,689
I'm sorry, we haven't yet.

672
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,560
You have 1 week to decide.
That's all for now.

673
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,734
I thought it was up to Ikeuchi to decide.

674
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:24,369
Well, but...

675
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,770
Anything is fine.

676
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:31,176
Why doesn't everyone write down a
song they like, and give it to me?

677
00:43:31,177 --> 00:43:32,910
Then we can choose from that list.

678
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,434
Which one is the dog?

679
00:43:53,435 --> 00:43:56,769
Yes, good job!

680
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,804
Next, we'll need to measure his
height and weight.

681
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:00,840
Okay.

682
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,470
That way, please.

683
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,660
Mrs. Ikeuchi, you have a phone call.

684
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,939
Hello, this is Mrs. Ikeuchi.

685
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,500
This is Dr. Mizuno of the neurology
department at University Clinic Jonan.

686
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,080
The results are ready.

687
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,449
Yes?

688
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:48,002
Could I please have you come to the
hospital as soon as possible?

689
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:53,254
If you could, I'd like you to bring
your husband as well.

690
00:44:54,255 --> 00:44:56,989
You're saying that...

691
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,830
this isn't a matter that can be
discussed over the phone?

692
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:07,074
It would be better for us to meet here.

693
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:08,640
I'll be waiting.

694
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:23,950
Um...

695
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,394
About the song for the singing contest...

696
00:45:32,395 --> 00:45:34,034
You have an idea?

697
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:36,704
It's not that.

698
00:45:36,705 --> 00:45:39,170
Um...

699
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:46,256
Since we have our first hour free,
why don't we discuss it together?

700
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:56,796
Um, since we're all a part of this contest...

701
00:45:56,807 --> 00:45:58,627
How should I put this...

702
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,960
I think we should all cooperate.

703
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,069
Where's your husband?

704
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,570
I came alone.

705
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,769
It's fine.

706
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:23,810
I work in health care,
and I used to be a nurse.

707
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,220
More than anything else,
I'm her mother.

708
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,094
Why don't we all propose our favorite songs?

709
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:37,489
Oh, give me a break.

710
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,299
I don't like debates.

711
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,564
The competition is just a waste of time anyways.

712
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:45,864
We don't have much time before the next test.

713
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:47,414
I want to study.

714
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:51,009
We'll still have plenty of time
for that, won't we?

715
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,714
I believe that the illness your
daughter is suffering from is

716
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:57,416
spinocerebellar degeneration.

717
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,602
Spinocerebellar degeneration?

718
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:03,719
I will run some more tests to be sure,

719
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,724
but I'm fairly sure that there's no mistake.

720
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,524
My father runs a tofu shop.

721
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:15,834
Originally, when he inherited the shop from
my grandfather, he was opposed to the idea,

722
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:18,769
so he tried other jobs.

723
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,139
At first he worked for City Hall,

724
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,439
but desk work just didn't suit him.

725
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,049
So he left City Hall and
tried several other jobs.

726
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:39,224
He grew tired of everything quickly
and never stayed any place very long

727
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:44,026
but he was able to make me a watch,

728
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,382
and this old fashioned T-shirt,

729
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:50,704
and his cooking is the be....

730
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:52,634
What are you talking about?

731
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:55,442
I don't understand the point of this.

732
00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:57,570
Um...

733
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,870
What I'm trying to say is...

734
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,619
Even though he constantly strayed
from the normal path

735
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,224
nothing he did was meaningless.

736
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,711
In the end, following his own path

737
00:48:15,712 --> 00:48:19,289
led to his decision to run the shop.

738
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:26,300
So, isn't it okay to take a different path every once in awhile?

739
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,825
The symptoms start slowly,
but will undoubtedly progress.

740
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,564
Although nerve damage will stop her
from being able to move freely

741
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:54,356
there will be no damage to the brain.

742
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:58,169
Even though she'll want to move,
she won't be able to.

743
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,559
When she wants to speak,
she won't be able to.

744
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:05,331
She will be fully aware of these limitations.

745
00:49:06,615 --> 00:49:10,503
It's an extraordinarily cruel disease.

746
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,380
It can be cured, right?

747
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:31,464
Instead of rushing forward, he immersed
himself in a variety of things.

748
00:49:31,465 --> 00:49:35,140
Shouldn't the class representative...

749
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,454
It can be cured, right?

750
00:50:06,986 --> 00:50:09,669
As far as I know,

751
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,310
nobody has ever recovered from it.

752
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,849
I don't think it's that bad

753
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,049
for people to waste a little time.

754
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:30,930
After all, we still have plenty of time left.

755
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,740
If I were a flower, I would be the bud.

756
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:47,270
If I were a flower, I would be the bud.
I want to treasure the early days of
my youth with no regrets.

[In the next episode]
What stupid doctor told you this?

777
00:53:06,585 --> 00:53:07,884
She can be cured, right?

778
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,871
There is no cure.

779
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:11,890
Why Aya?

780
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,020
It's unfortunate, but it's the truth.

Mom, what disease do I have?
