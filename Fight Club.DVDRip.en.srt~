1
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,500
People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.

2
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Three minutes.

3
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,600
This is it. Ground zero.

4
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,300
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

5
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.

6
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,800
l can't think of anything.

7
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,600
For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing

8
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,800
and l wonderhow clean that gun is.

9
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,800
lt's getting exciting now.

10
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,100
Well, it works both ways.

12
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,300
We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.

13
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,000
The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,400
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,400
ln two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges

16
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,700
and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
l know this because Tyler knows this.

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,000
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,300
Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,

20
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,400
has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.

21
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,100
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.

22
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,300
This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.

23
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,500
The big moosie slobbering all overme,
that was Bob.

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
We're still men.

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Yes, we're men.

26
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Men is what we are.

27
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,400
Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.

28
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,200
He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,200
and his body upped the oestrogen.

30
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,900
- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.

31
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,300
..between those huge sweating tits

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,500
that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.

33
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,700
OK, you cry now.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,200
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

35
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,000
For six months, I couldn't sleep.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
l couldn't sleep.

37
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,700
With insomnia, nothing's real.

38
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,700
Everything's faraway.

39
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,900
Everything's a copy of a copy

40
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
of a copy.

41
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,600
When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.

42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,600
The IBM Stellar Sphere.

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,900
The Microsoft Galaxy.

44
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,000
The Planet Starbucks.

45
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,500
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

46
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,900
It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.

47
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,500
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

48
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,000
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

49
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,800
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.

50
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:35,700
 

51
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,800
Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.

52
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,100
Yes. l'd like to order

53
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,300
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

54
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,400
- Please hold.
- Anything clever,

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,800
like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
l had to have it.

56
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,000
The Klipsk personal office unit.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,300
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,100
Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,500
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.

60
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,100
l'd flip through catalogues and wonder

61
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
''What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?''

62
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,900
I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,900
proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...

64
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,700
- Please hold.
- ..wherever.

65
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,200
We used to read pornography.

66
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Now it was the Horchow collection.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,400
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

68
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,700
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,700
I have no idea how I got there.

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,600
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

71
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,100
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...

72
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,800
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,900
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,700
Hey, come on.

75
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,800
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

77
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,400
See the guys with testicular cancer.

78
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,400
That's pain.

79
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,000
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,300
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,300
We never could agree on anything.

82
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
Well, I... She...

83
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,800
She had her first child last week.

84
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,000
A girl.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,300
With... With her... With her new husband.

86
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,000
Fuck!

87
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
Thank God, you know...

88
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm glad for her.

89
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,000
She deserves...

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,400
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

91
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Thank you, Thomas.

92
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,800
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

93
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,900
And that gives me strength.

94
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,200
We give each other strength.

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,500
It's time for the one-on-ones.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,400
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

97
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Could you find a partner?

98
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,500
And this is how I met the big moosie.

99
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,100
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.

100
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.

101
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,200
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

102
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,000
Bob had been a champion body builder.

103
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,800
You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?

104
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
That was his idea.

105
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,800
I was a juicer.

106
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,900
You know, using steroids?

107
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,400
Diabonal and

108
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,700
Wisterol.

109
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,600
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

110
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,000
And now I'm bankrupt.

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
I'm divorced.

112
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,600
My two grown kids

113
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,000
won't even return my phone calls.

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,100
Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.

115
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,700
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

116
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
You can cry.

117
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,200
And then... something happened.
I let go.

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
That's really good.

119
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,300
Lost in oblivion.

120
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,600
Dark and silent and complete.

121
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,100
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.

122
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,400
lt's OK.

123
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,700
Babies don't sleep this well.

124
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,700
I became addicted.

125
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,800
If I didn't say anything

126
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,400
people always assumed the worst.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,100
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,100
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,100
I wasn't really dying.

130
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,000
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

131
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,600
I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.

132
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

133
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,500
It moves over your body, healing you.

134
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,900
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

135
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,500
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

136
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,300
Where does it lead?

137
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,400
To your cave.

138
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,300
Step forward

139
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,500
into your cave.

140
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
That's right.

141
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,000
You're going deeper into your cave.

142
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,700
And you're going to find

143
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,800
your power animal.

144
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
Slide.

145
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,700
Every evening I died.

146
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,400
And every evening I was born again.

147
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,900
Resurrected.

148
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,700
Being there, pressed against his tits,

150
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,800
ready to cry.

151
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,500
This was my vacation.

152
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
And she

153
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,800
ruined everything.

154
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,900
This is cancer, right?

155
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
This chick, Marla Singer,

156
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,500
did not have testicular cancer.

157
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,600
She was a liar.

158
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,600
She had no diseases at all.

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,400
I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.

160
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,700
Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.

161
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,100
And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Fridaynight.

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Marla,

163
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,400
the big tourist.

164
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,500
Her lie reflected my lie.

165
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,000
And suddenly, I felt nothing.

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
I couldn't cry. So once again,

167
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,700
I couldn't sleep.

168
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,600
Next group, after guided meditation,

169
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,000
after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,100
I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.

171
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

172
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,300
I hadn't slept in four days.

173
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,100
We'll just let that dry...

174
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,600
When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.

175
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
And you're never really awake.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
To begin tonight's communion,

177
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,200
Chloe would like to say a few words.

178
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,200
Oh, yeah. Chloe.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,900
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around

180
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,800
being extra nice to everybody.

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Well, I'm still here.

182
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
But I don't know for how long.

183
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,500
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

184
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,400
But I've got some good news.

185
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,200
I no longer have any fear of death.

186
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,500
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

187
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,500
No-one will have sex with me.

188
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm so close to the end,
and all l want is to get laid for the last time.

189
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,800
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

190
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,400
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

191
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,000
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,200
Thank you, Chloe.

193
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

194
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,900
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

195
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,800
You step inside your cave and you walk...

196
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,800
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.

197
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Marla.

198
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,200
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.

199
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,200
But you can't.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
..deeper into your cave as you walk.

201
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,300
You feel a healing energy all around you.

202
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,800
Now find your power animal.

203
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Slide.

204
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,300
OK. Let's partner up.

205
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,500
Pick someone special to you tonight.

206
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,500
Hey.

207
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

208
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,400
- I'm onto you.
- What?

209
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,500
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

210
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,300
Sorry?

211
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,300
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, l know we're all dying.

212
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,400
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

213
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,900
So you're a tourist.

214
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,100
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

215
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,500
I saw you at testicular cancer!

216
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,100
I saw you practising this.

217
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,500
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

218
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,300
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

219
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,100
I'll expose you.

220
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,200
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

221
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,700
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

222
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,400
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

223
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,100
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

224
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,900
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

225
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,900
I've been coming for over a year.

226
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,200
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

227
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,900
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

228
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

229
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,100
Yeah. Yeah.

230
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,900
Share yourself... completely.

231
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,700
Look, you don't want to get into this.

232
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

233
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

234
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,000
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

235
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,600
Candystripe a cancer ward.
lt's not my problem.

236
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,600
No, wait a second. Hold on.

237
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
We'll split up the week, OK?

238
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,800
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

239
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,900
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

240
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,200
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

241
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

242
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

243
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,300
No. No.

244
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,000
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

245
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

246
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,100
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

247
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,800
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

248
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,300
So far, you have four. I only have two.

249
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,300
Now we both have three...

251
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,500
Hey! You left half your clothes.

252
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,400
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

253
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm selling some clothes!

254
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,500
So! We each have three. That's six.

255
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,300
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

256
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
The girl had done her homework.

257
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,500
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

258
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,100
That's your favorite too?

259
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,600
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

260
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,700
Take the first and third Sunday.

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
Deal.

262
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Looks like this is goodbye.

263
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,700
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

264
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,100
How's this for not making a big thing?

265
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Hey, Marla!

266
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,600
Marla!

267
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,100
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

268
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,100
Should we?

269
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,100
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

270
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,400
This is how I met Marla Singer.

271
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,200
Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.

272
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,500
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.

273
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

274
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,300
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,100
You wake up at SeaTac.

276
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,000
SFO. LAX.

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,400
You wake up at O'Hare.

278
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,500
Dallas Fort Worth.

279
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
BWI.

280
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,200
Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.

281
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,100
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

282
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,300
This is your life,
and it's ending one minute ata time.

283
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
You wake up at Air Harbor International.

284
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,300
If you wake up ata different time,
in a different place,

285
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,800
could you wake up as a different person?

286
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Everywhere I travel,

287
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,200
tiny life.

288
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,700
Single-serving sugar and cream.

289
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,500
Single pat of butter.

290
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,300
The microwave cordon bleu hobbykit.

291
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,200
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

292
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,100
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.

293
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,900
The people I meet on each flight,

294
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
they're single-serving friends.

295
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Between take off and landing,
we have our time together.

296
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,900
That's all we get.

297
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,800
Welcome!

298
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,900
On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

299
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,500
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.

300
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,900
The infant went through the windshield.

301
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,900
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.

302
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,900
The rear differential locks up.

303
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,400
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

304
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,800
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

305
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,300
The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.

306
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Now, should we initiate a recall?

307
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,500
The father must have been huge.

308
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,700
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

309
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
Very modern art.

310
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,200
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.

311
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,900
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.

312
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,700
Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.

313
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,600
A x B x C

314
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,600
equals X.

315
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,300
lf X is less than the cost of a recall,

316
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
we don't do one.

317
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,500
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

318
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,300
You wouldn't believe.

319
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,200
Which car company do you work for?

320
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,300
A major one.

321
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,

322
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,700
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.

323
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
Anything.

324
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,900
Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.

325
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,000
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

326
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,400
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

327
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,800
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

328
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,400
lt's a lot of responsibility.

329
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,600
Wanna switch seats?

330
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,000
No. l'm not sure
l'm the man for that particular job.

331
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,400
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

332
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
The illusion of safety.

333
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,600
Yeah. I guess so.

334
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

335
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,000
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

336
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,400
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

337
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,800
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

338
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,100
You accept your fate.

339
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
It's all right here.

340
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,800
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

341
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,700
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

342
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
That's...

343
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,000
That's an interesting theory.

344
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,000
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

345
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,000
What do you do for a living?

346
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,300
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

347
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
OK.

348
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,100
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

349
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
We have the exact same briefcase.

350
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Soap.

351
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,500
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

352
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,800
The yardstick of civilization.

353
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
And this is how I met...

354
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,000
Tyler Durden.

355
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,400
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

356
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

357
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,000
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

358
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,400
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

360
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,800
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

361
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,300
Thank you.

362
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,400
How's it working out for you?

363
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,100
- What?
- Being clever?

364
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,500
Great.

365
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,400
Keep it up, then. Right up.

366
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,600
A question of etiquette.

367
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,700
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

368
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,600
How I came to live with Tyleris...

369
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

370
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,700
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

371
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,800
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

372
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,900
But when a suitcase vibrates,

373
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,600
the throwers have got to call the police.

374
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,100
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out often

375
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,200
it's an electric razor.

376
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,300
But... every once in a while

377
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,100
it's a dildo.

378
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,800
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

379
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,600
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never

380
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,600
your dildo.

381
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I don't own...

382
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,300
I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.

383
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,400
My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.

384
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,200
Never mind.

385
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,600
Hey! That's my car!

386
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Home was a condo on the 15th floor

387
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.

388
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,200
The walls were solid concrete.

389
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,200
A foot of concrete is important

390
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,500
when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.

391
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,300
Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects

392
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.

393
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,600
l suppose these things happen.

394
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
There's... nothing up there.

395
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,300
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

396
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,000
Do you have somebody you can call?

397
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,100
How embarrassing.

398
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,000
A houseful of condiments and no food.

399
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,700
The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out

400
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
letting out justa little bit of gas.

401
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,700
That gas could have filled the condo.

402
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,200
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.

403
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,700
Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.

404
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Yeah?

405
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
I can hear you breathing...

406
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,700
If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.

407
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,300
- Hello?
- Who's this?

408
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,400
- Tyler?
- Who is this?

409
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,100
We met... We met on the airplane.

410
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,300
We had the same suitcase?

411
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,400
The clever guy?

412
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,700
Oh, yeah. Right.

413
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,200
l called a second ago. There was no answer.

414
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,400
- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.

415
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,900
So what's up?

416
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Well.

417
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,600
You're not gonna believe this.

418
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,700
You know, it could be worse.

419
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,500
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

420
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,400
There's always that. I don't know.

421
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,500
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

422
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,600
That's the last sofa I'll need.

423
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,400
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

424
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,800
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

425
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,200
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

426
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,400
I was close to being complete.

427
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,900
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

428
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,600
All gone.

429
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Do you know what a duvet is?

430
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,600
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

431
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

432
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,600
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

433
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,300
No.

434
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
What are we, then?

435
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,800
I dunno. Consumers.

436
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,900
Right. We're consumers.

437
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,100
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

438
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,000
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

439
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,400
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

440
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,400
television with 500 channels,

441
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,100
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

442
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Viagra. Olestra.

443
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,000
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

444
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,300
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
lt's all going down.

445
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,100
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

446
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,300
I say never be complete.

447
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
I say stop being perfect.

448
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
I say let's evolve.

449
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,600
Let the chips fall where they may.

450
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,700
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

451
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

452
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,300
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

453
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,100
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

454
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,500
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

455
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,500
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

456
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,700
What?

457
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,900
The things you own end up owning you.

458
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,000
Do what you like, man.

459
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, it's late.

460
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,700
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

461
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,800
I should find a hotel.

462
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
What?

463
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,100
What?

464
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

465
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,400
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

466
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

467
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,500
What?

468
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,200
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

469
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,500
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

470
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,100
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

471
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,900
Would... Would that be a problem?

472
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,000
Is it a problem for you to ask?

473
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,100
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

474
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,400
Thanks.

475
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,400
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

476
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,800
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

477
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
What?

478
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,500
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

479
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,300
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.

480
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,800
Tyler was a night person.

481
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

482
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,100
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

483
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,100
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
lt comes on a few.

484
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,700
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

485
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,000
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

486
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,800
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

487
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,500
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

488
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,500
That's the cue for a changeover.

489
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,300
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

490
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,400
Why would anyone want this shit job?

491
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,600
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

492
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

493
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,900
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

494
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,100
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

495
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,100
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

496
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,600
Nice, big cock.

497
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,900
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

498
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

499
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,300
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

500
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,500
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

501
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,800
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

502
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,300
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

503
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Go ahead, tell 'em.

504
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
You get the idea.

505
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,700
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

506
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,000
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

507
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,900
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

508
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,200
I don't wanna die without any scars.

509
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,500
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

510
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,600
So go crazy! Let it rip.

511
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,300
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

512
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,300
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

513
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,800
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

514
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,900
That's right.

515
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,000
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

516
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,100
This is so fucking stupid.

517
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,600
Motherfucker!

518
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,800
He hit me in the ear!

519
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,900
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

520
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,900
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

521
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,600
No, that was perfect.

522
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,000
No, it's all right.

523
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
It really hurts.

524
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,300
Right.

525
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,700
Hit me again.

526
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,800
No, you hit me. Come on!

527
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,500
We should do this again sometime.

528
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,900
- Where's your car?
- What car?

529
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,200
I don't know how Tyler found that house

530
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,500
but he said he'd been there for a year.

531
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,400
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.

532
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800
Most of the windows were boarded up.

533
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,100
There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.

534
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,000
The stairs were ready to collapse.

535
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,600
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.

536
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,100
Neither would have surprised me.

537
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Yep. That's you.

538
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,400
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

539
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,500
Yeah, thanks.

540
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,400
What a shithole.

541
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,300
Nothing worked.

542
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,700
Turning on one light meant
another lightin the house went out.

543
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,400
There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a papermill.

544
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,300
That fartsmell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.

545
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,300
What have we here?

546
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,400
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

547
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Every time itrained, we had to kill the power.

548
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,100
By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.

549
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,300
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.

550
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,100
Can I be next?

551
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
All right, man.

552
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,300
Lose the tie.

553
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,500
At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.

554
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,400
Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.

555
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,200
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.

556
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,300
Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.

557
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,900
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.

558
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,000
Hey, man. What are you reading?

559
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,300
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

560
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,000
''I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

561
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing.''

562
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,500
There's a whole series of these.

563
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,600
''I Am Jill's Nipples.''

564
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,400
- ''I Am Jack's Colon.''
- ''I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack.''

565
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,100
After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.

566
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,600
What?

567
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,200
- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?

568
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,100
If you could choose,
who would you fight?

569
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,100
I'd fight my boss, probably.

570
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,300
Really?

571
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,600
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

572
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,600
I don't know my dad.

573
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,500
I mean, I know him, but...

574
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,900
He left when I was like, six years old.

575
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,900
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

576
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,900
He did this every six years.

577
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,000
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

578
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,800
My dad never went to college.

579
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,700
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

580
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,100
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, ''Dad, now what?''

581
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
- He says, ''Get a job.''
- Same here.

582
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,600
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

583
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
''Dad, now what?''

584
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,700
He says, ''I dunno. Get married.''

585
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,200
You can't get married.

586
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,800
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

587
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,400
We're a generation of men raised by women.

588
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,600
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

589
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,400
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.

590
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,600
But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.

591
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,100
We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.

592
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,300
It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'dj ust clean my condo.

593
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,300
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.

594
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,300
I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.

595
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,000
I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.

596
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,800
But I wasn't.

597
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,500
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

598
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,300
Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.

599
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

600
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,300
Absolutely.

601
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,700
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

602
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,400
Because waste is a thief.

603
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,500
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

604
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,800
You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.

605
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,900
It was right in everyone's face.

606
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,000
Tyler and I just made it visible.

607
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,600
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

608
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,600
Tyler and I just gave ita name.

609
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,300
Come on, you've gotta go home!

610
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,900
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

611
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,600
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.

612
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
Gentlemen!

613
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,300
Welcome to Fight Club.

614
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
The first rule of Fight Club is

615
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,700
you do not talk about Fight Club.

616
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,300
The second rule of Fight Club is

617
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,100
you do not talk about Fight Club!

618
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,300
Third rule of Fight Club.

619
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,000
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

620
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,800
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

621
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,100
Only two guys to a fight.

622
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,000
Fifth rule.

623
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,600
One fight at a time, fellas.

624
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,100
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

625
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,000
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

626
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,200
And the eighth and final rule.

627
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,400
If this is your first night at Fight Club

628
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,400
you have to fight.

629
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
This kid from work, Ricky,

630
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,800
couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.

631
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,200
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes

632
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,500
when he trounced
the maitre d' ofa local food court.

633
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:16,400
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.

634
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,900
Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...

635
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Stop!

636
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,800
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

637
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,500
But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.

638
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

639
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,100
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.

640
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,400
Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.

641
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,500
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.

642
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,100
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.

643
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,000
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

644
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,100
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

645
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,000
Hemingway. You?

646
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,600
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

647
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,800
We all started seeing things differently.

648
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,200
Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.

649
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,400
l felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,

650
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,400
trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.

651
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,400
Is that what a man looks like?

652
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,100
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

653
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Now, self-destruction...

654
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
Excuse me.

655
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,500
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.

656
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
It wasn't about words.

657
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,700
The hysterical shouting was in tongues

658
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
like at a Pentecostal Church.

659
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,000
- Is that it?
- Stop!

660
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,900
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.

661
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,700
But nothing mattered.

662
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,600
Cool.

663
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,200
Afterwards, we all felt saved.

664
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,300
Hey, man. How about next week?

665
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
How about next month?!

666
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,500
Irvine, you're in the middle.

667
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
New guy, you too.

668
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,300
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

669
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,400
He fell down some stairs.

670
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,100
I fell down some stairs.

671
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,400
Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hairshort or trim your fingernails.

672
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,700
OK. Any historical figure.

673
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,600
I'd fight Gandhi.

674
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,000
Good answer.

675
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,200
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

676
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,800
Lincoln?

677
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,400
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

678
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
Fuck!

679
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,900
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

680
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,900
Hello?

681
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,300
Where have you been the last eight weeks?

682
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,600
Marla?

683
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,600
- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.

684
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,500
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

685
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,700
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?

686
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,500
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

687
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,000
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

688
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,700
I found a new one.

689
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,400
- Really?
- It's for men only.

690
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,000
Like the testicle thing?

691
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,600
Look, this is a bad time.

692
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,000
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

693
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,600
- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.

694
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,900
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

695
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,100
I took what was left of a bottle.

696
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,300
It might have been too much.

697
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,900
Picture Marla Singer throw herseIf
around her crummy apartment.

698
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,300
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

699
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,100
So you're staying in tonight, then?

700
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,000
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

701
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,500
Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?

702
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,100
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

703
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,000
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.

704
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,700
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

705
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,900
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

706
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,100
What are you doing here?

707
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,800
What?

708
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,200
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

709
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Fuck you!

710
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,700
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

711
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Limber, though.

712
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,700
Silly cooze.

713
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,300
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

714
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,400
Guess who's on the other end?

715
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,500
I knew the story before he told me.

716
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,200
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

717
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,000
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

718
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,600
Or will it just be a death hairball?

719
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,800
Prepare to evacuate soul.

720
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,300
Ten,

721
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,100
nine,... eight...

722
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,300
How could Tyler, of all people,

723
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,100
think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?

724
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,800
Five,

725
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,300
four...

726
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,100
Hang on.

727
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,500
You got here fast.

728
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,000
Did I call you?

729
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,300
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

730
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,700
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

731
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,100
Oh, fuck!

732
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,300
Somebody called the cops.

733
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,100
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

734
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,600
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

735
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,600
She has lost faith in herself.

736
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,600
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

737
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,600
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

738
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,300
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

739
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,900
If I fall asleep,

740
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,200
I'm done for.

741
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,200
You're gonna have to keep me up

742
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,300
all night.

743
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,700
Un-fucking-believable.

744
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,800
He was obviously able to handle it.

745
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,500
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

746
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,500
- Never?
- No.

747
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,400
You're not into her, are you?

748
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,500
No! God, not at all.

749
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,100
I am Jack's raging bile duct.

750
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,000
Are you sure? You can tell me.

751
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,900
Believe me, l'm sure.

752
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,200
- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.

753
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,900
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

754
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,300
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

755
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,900
My God.

756
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,300
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

757
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,700
How could Tyler not go for that?

758
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,200
The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.

759
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,000
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a case worker.

760
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,600
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

761
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,400
She invaded my support groups
and now my home.

762
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
Hey, hey. Sit down.

763
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,800
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

764
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,500
Why would I...

765
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,900
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

766
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,400
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

767
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,500
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

768
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,900
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

769
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,200
If only l had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,

770
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,200
none of this would have happened.

771
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,800
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

772
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,500
l could have moved to another room.

773
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,200
On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.

774
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,300
But I didn't.

775
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,500
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

776
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,500
Wanna finish her off?

777
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,700
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

778
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,100
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

779
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,200
I became the calm little center of the world.

780
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,900
I was the Zen master.

781
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,700
I wrote little haiku poems.

782
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,600
I e-mailed them to everyone.

783
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,700
Is that your blood?

784
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
Some of it, yeah.

785
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,900
You can't smoke in here.

786
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,000
Take the rest of the day off.

787
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,500
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

788
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,600
Get yourself together.

789
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,200
I got right in everyone's hostile face.

790
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,700
''Yes, these are bruises from fighting.''

791
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,700
''Yes, I'm comfortable with that.''

792
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,600
''I am enlightened.''

793
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,600
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,

794
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,500
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,

795
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,300
and you have to come home to this.

796
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,800
- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.

797
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,000
We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.

798
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,200
Yes.

799
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,100
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

800
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,600
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.

801
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,600
No, I wasn't aware of that.

802
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,600
I am Jack's coldsweat.

803
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,900
Does this sound strange to you?

804
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,800
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.

805
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,700
- The dynamite
- Dynamite?

806
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,800
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

807
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,300
- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?

808
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,200
It means it was home-made.

809
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,400
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

810
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:24,900
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

811
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,800
- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?

812
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,800
- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.

813
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,300
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

814
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,300
Excuse me. Are you there?

815
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,200
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

816
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,600
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

817
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,800
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

818
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,800
especially material possessions.

819
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,700
- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.

820
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,300
- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.

821
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,100
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

822
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,700
That condo was my life. OK?

823
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,300
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

824
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,300
That was not just a bunch ofstuff
that got destroyed.

825
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,100
- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.

826
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,100
- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

827
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,900
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

828
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:20,700
- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

829
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,600
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

830
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,900
- OK?
- OK.

831
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,000
Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

832
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,000
My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.

833
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,700
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

834
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,500
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

835
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,600
You... dance all night.

836
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,600
Then you throw it away.

837
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,400
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

838
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,200
What?

839
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,700
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

840
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,500
It was worth every penny.

841
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,600
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

842
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,700
Someone loved it intensely

843
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,600
for one day.

844
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,700
Then tossed it.

845
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,500
Like a Christmas tree.

846
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,600
So special.

847
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,100
Then

848
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,800
bam!

849
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It's on the side of the road.

850
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,600
Tinsel still clinging to it.

851
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,500
Like a sex crime victim.

852
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,600
Underwear inside out.

853
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,000
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

854
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,600
You can borrow it sometime.

855
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,300
Get rid of her.

856
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,900
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

857
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:56,100
I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.

858
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,400
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

859
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,000
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

860
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,700
Gotta get off

861
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,000
Thanks. Bye.

862
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,900
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

863
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,200
Gonna get, need to get...

864
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,300
Gotta get...

865
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,700
You kids!

866
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,100
Why do you still waste time with her?

867
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,400
I'll say this about Marla.

868
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,700
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

869
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,000
And I'm not?

870
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,800
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

871
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,900
What are we doing tonight?

872
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,700
Tonight... we make soap.

873
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,600
Really?

874
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,500
To make soap, first we render fat.

875
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,700
The salt balance has to be just right

876
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,300
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

877
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,100
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

878
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,700
Pay dirt!

879
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:30,500
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

880
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,300
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

881
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,900
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

882
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,200
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

883
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,100
Like in Boy Scouts.

884
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,900
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

885
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:06,600
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

886
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,900
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

887
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,700
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

888
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:16,500
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

889
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,500
Tyler was full of useful information.

890
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,400
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

891
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,400
- You know why?
- No.

892
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,800
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

893
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,000
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

894
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,400
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

895
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:41,100
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

896
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,100
May I see your hand, please?

897
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,400
What is this?

898
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,000
This is a chemical burn.

899
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,500
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

900
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,000
Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.

901
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,400
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

902
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,600
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

903
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,500
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

904
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,300
I tried not to think
of the word searing offlesh.

905
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,400
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

906
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,100
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

907
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,100
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

908
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

909
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,600
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

910
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,100
I am not!

911
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,000
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

912
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,200
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

913
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,300
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

914
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,300
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

915
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,700
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

916
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,600
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

917
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,000
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

918
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,500
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

919
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,000
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

920
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,900
First, you have to give up.

921
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,800
First, you have to know, not fear,

922
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,600
know that some day, you're gonna die.

923
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,900
You don't know how this feels!

924
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,900
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

925
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,700
OK.

926
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Congratulations.

927
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,300
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

928
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,100
Tyler soldhis soap
to departmentstores at $20 a bar.

929
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,100
God knows what they charged.

930
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,300
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

931
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,300
It was beautiful.

932
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,200
We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.

933
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,100
He was wearing his yellow tie.

934
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,300
I didn't wear a tie to work anymore.

935
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,000
''The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club.''

936
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,500
I'm haIf-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.

937
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,900
''The second rule...'' Is this yours?

938
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,100
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

939
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,600
You find this. What would you do?

940
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,900
Well, I gotta tell you,

941
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:38,500
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

942
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,800
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

943
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:46,200
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

944
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,000
and then stalk from office to office

945
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

946
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:58,400
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

947
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,200
This might be someone
you've known for years.

948
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,200
Someone very, very close to you.

949
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,600
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.

950
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,500
And I used to be such a nice guy.

951
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,800
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

952
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,100
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

953
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,400
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

954
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,900
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

955
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,700
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

956
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,700
I don't know about this, Marla.

957
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,500
Please.

958
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,500
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutralin her book.

959
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,300
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

960
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,400
Where are they, exactly?

961
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,500
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

962
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,500
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

963
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,500
Thanks for the thought.

964
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,100
What happened to your hand?

965
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,200
Oh, nothing.

966
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,300
Right there?

967
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,900
- Feel anything?
- No.

968
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,800
Well, make sure.

969
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,000
OK, I'm pretty sure.

970
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,900
You feel nothing?

971
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,200
No, nothing.

972
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,400
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

973
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,000
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

974
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,100
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

975
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,600
- I could check your prostate.
- I think l'm OK.

976
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,700
Well, thanks, anyway.

977
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,700
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

978
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,900
See you... around.

979
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,400
Cornelius?

980
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,800
Cornelius!

981
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,500
It's me! Bob!

982
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,900
Hey, Bob.

983
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,300
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

984
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:24,200
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

985
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,700
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

986
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,300
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

987
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,600
Well...

988
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:38,000
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

989
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,000
And the second rule is

990
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,300
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

991
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,700
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

992
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,800
Look at my face, Bob.

993
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,300
That's fucking... fucking great.

994
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:56,000
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

995
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,600
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

996
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,200
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

997
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,800
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

998
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,700
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

999
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,300
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

1000
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,700
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1001
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,800
He's a great man.

1002
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,500
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1003
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,400
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1004
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,600
Actually, you did.

1005
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,600
Thank you for this.

1006
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1007
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,200
Fight Club.

1008
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,300
This was mine and Tyler's gift.

1009
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
Our gift to the world.

1010
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,700
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1011
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,300
Shut up!

1012
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:11,200
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1013
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,100
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1014
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,100
I see all this potential.

1015
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,100
And I see it squandered.

1016
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,100
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1017
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,600
Waiting tables.

1018
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,600
Slaves with white collars.

1019
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,100
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1020
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,300
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1021
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,300
We're the middle children of history.

1022
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,400
No purpose or place.

1023
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,600
We have no Great War.

1024
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,900
No Great Depression.

1025
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,900
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1026
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,600
Our great depression is our lives.

1027
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:10,200
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1028
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,900
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1029
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,800
But we won't.

1030
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,300
We're slowly learning that fact.

1031
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,700
And we're very, very pissed off.

1032
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,400
Yeah!

1033
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,500
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1034
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,900
Who are you?

1035
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,200
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,800
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1037
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:47,600
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1038
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,700
Tyler Durden.

1039
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,100
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1040
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,300
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1041
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,900
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1042
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,000
He don't own this place. I do.

1043
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,500
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1044
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,300
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

1045
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,100
It is, actually.

1046
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,500
Look, stupid fuck!

1047
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,000
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1048
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,300
You should join our club.

1049
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,500
Did you hear what I just said?

1050
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,700
You and your friend.

1051
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,500
You hear me now?

1052
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,500
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1053
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,400
Still not getting it.

1054
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,500
OK, OK, I got it.

1055
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,900
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1056
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,600
Back! All ofyou!

1057
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,300
Everybody back!

1058
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,600
Ah, Lou!

1059
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,200
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1060
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,700
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1061
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,500
Oh, yeah!

1062
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,300
Is that fucking funny?

1063
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,900
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1064
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,400
Unbelievable.

1065
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:46,300
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1066
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,100
You don't know where I've been!

1067
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,100
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1068
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,400
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1069
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,300
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1070
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,300
On my mother's eyes.

1071
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,000
Thanks, Lou.

1072
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,300
You too, big guy.

1073
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,200
We'll see you next week.

1074
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,500
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1075
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,300
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1076
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,400
You're gonna start a fight

1077
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,500
and you're gonna lose.

1078
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,200
Excellent choice, sir.

1079
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,900
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1080
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,800
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.

1081
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Son of a bitch!

1082
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,900
Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.

1083
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,700
Excuse me!

1084
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,400
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1085
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,300
Jay! Go call 911!

1086
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,900
Put the hose down.

1087
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,000
Stop it! Stop it!

1088
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,400
Sorry.

1089
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,600
We need to talk.

1090
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,800
OK.

1091
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,800
Where to begin?

1092
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,100
With your constant absenteeism?

1093
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,700
With your unpresentable appearance?

1094
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,700
You're up for review.

1095
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,900
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1096
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,700
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1097
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,600
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1098
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,200
Someone informs you that this company

1099
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,300
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

1100
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,600
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1101
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:26,000
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1102
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,700
What then?

1103
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:30,000
Are you threatening me?

1104
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,800
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1105
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,200
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1106
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,200
In exchange for my salary,

1107
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,000
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1108
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:47,200
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1109
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:52,400
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1110
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,800
- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.

1111
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,300
What the hell are you doing?

1112
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,300
That hurt.

1113
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,600
Why would you do that?

1114
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,100
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1115
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,100
What are you doing?

1116
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,100
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1117
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:47,300
For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.

1118
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,700
No!

1119
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,500
Under and behind and inside
everything this man took forgranted,

1120
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,900
something horrible had been growing.

1121
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,000
Look.

1122
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,800
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1123
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,400
Then, at our most excellent
moment together...

1124
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,900
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1125
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,000
Telephone, computer,

1126
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,200
fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.

1127
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,500
We now had corporate sponsorship.

1128
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:48,600
This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club everynight of the week.

1129
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,600
Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.

1130
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,900
The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.

1131
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:04,000
Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel

1132
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,200
over the urine content of their soup.

1133
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
l am Jack's wasted life.

1134
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,500
Thank you, sir.

1135
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,800
Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.

1136
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,300
He handed them outin sealed envelopes.

1137
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:11,400
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1138
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,200
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1139
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,400
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1140
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,500
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1141
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,900
No.

1142
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,900
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

1143
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,900
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1144
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,400
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1145
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,300
Human sacrifice.

1146
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,700
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

1147
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,000
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

1148
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,300
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1149
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,100
On a long enough time line,

1150
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,000
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

1151
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,000
What are you doing? Come on!

1152
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:37,300
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

1153
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,200
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1154
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,000
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

1155
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,600
They give shitty apartments letters.

1156
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,700
Raymond! You're going to die.

1157
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,100
No!

1158
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,300
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1159
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,500
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1160
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,000
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

1161
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,900
An expired community college student lD.
What did you study, Raymond?

1162
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,900
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1163
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,900
Were the midterms hard?

1164
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,400
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1165
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,900
- Why?
- I don't know.

1166
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,900
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1167
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,100
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1168
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1169
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,100
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1170
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,000
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1171
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,500
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1172
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,900
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1173
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:45,400
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1174
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,900
Please, no.

1175
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
I'm keeping your license.

1176
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1177
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,900
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

1178
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,000
you will be dead.

1179
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,800
Now run on home.

1180
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,300
Run, Forrest, run!

1181
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,900
I feel ill.

1182
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,600
Imagine how he feels.

1183
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,700
Come on, this isn't funny!

1184
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,100
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1185
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:27,200
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1186
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:31,600
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1187
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,800
You had to give it to him.

1188
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,200
- Come on.
- He had a plan.

1189
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,600
And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.

1190
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,500
No fear. No distractions.

1191
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,800
The ability to let that which does not matter

1192
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,800
truly slide.

1193
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,600
You are not your job.

1194
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,800
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1195
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,400
You're not the car you drive.

1196
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,600
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1197
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,900
You're not your fucking khakis.

1198
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,200
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1199
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,700
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1200
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,500
You don't have to go.

1201
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,900
Whatever.

1202
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:44,000
No, I mean... It's OK.

1203
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,200
Are you still going to groups?

1204
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,800
Yeah.

1205
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,200
Chloe's dead.

1206
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,600
Wow, Chloe.

1207
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,500
When did that happen?

1208
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,800
Do you care?

1209
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,200
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1210
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,400
Yeah, well...

1211
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,800
It was the smart move on her part.

1212
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,100
Listen...

1213
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,500
What are you getting out of all this?

1214
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,200
What?

1215
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,600
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1216
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,300
Is this making you happy?

1217
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,800
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1218
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,500
I don't know. I don't understand.

1219
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,100
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1220
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,100
What is... What is that?

1221
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,200
What do you get out of it?

1222
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,700
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1223
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,800
It's totally different with us.

1224
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,900
Us?

1225
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
What do you mean by us?

1226
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,600
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1227
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1228
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,300
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1229
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,100
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1230
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,600
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1231
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,700
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1232
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,700
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1233
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,200
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1234
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,700
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1235
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,900
My God. Who did this?

1236
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,000
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1237
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,800
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1238
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,400
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1239
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,300
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1240
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,500
Let go of me!

1241
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,300
- This conversation
- This conversation

1242
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,700
- is over.
- is over.

1243
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,500
I just can't win with you, can I?

1244
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,800
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1245
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,700
What is... What is all this?

1246
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,700
What do you think?

1247
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,700
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1248
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,500
Hey!

1249
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,800
Too young.

1250
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,400
Sorry.

1251
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,600
What's all that?

1252
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,600
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1253
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,200
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1254
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,400
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1255
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,500
he may enter and begin training.

1256
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,300
Training for what?

1257
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,700
You think this is a game?

1258
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,300
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1259
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,000
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1260
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,700
Bad news, friend.

1261
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,000
It's not gonna happen.

1262
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,400
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1263
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,300
It's not the end of the world.

1264
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,500
Just... go away.

1265
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,300
Go.

1266
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,900
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1267
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,800
Don't you look at me!

1268
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,100
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1269
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,400
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1270
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,800
Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.

1271
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,700
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1272
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,900
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,200
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,100
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,200
- One blackjacket.
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,200
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1277
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,200
All right.

1278
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,600
You're too old, fat man.

1279
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,800
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1280
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,200
Bob! Bob!

1281
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,200
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1282
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,200
Space monkey.

1283
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:30,800
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1284
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,600
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1285
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,800
And you... You're too fucking

1286
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,400
blond!

1287
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,700
Get out of here, the both of you!

1288
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,800
And so it went.

1289
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,000
Listen up, maggots.

1290
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,100
You are not special.

1291
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,600
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1292
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,000
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1293
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:03,000
Tyler built himself an army.

1294
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,800
We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap ofthe world.

1295
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:10,400
We are all part of the same compost heap.

1296
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,500
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?

1297
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,400
To what purpose?

1298
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,900
For what greater good?

1299
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
In Tyler we trusted.

1300
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,800
When he was like,
''You are not your job'',

1301
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,800
I was like, ''Yeah!''

1302
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,600
Hey, what's all this?

1303
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,700
Hey!

1304
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,800
OK!

1305
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,100
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1306
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,600
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1307
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,600
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1308
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,800
The same great taste, Pepsi.

1309
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:05,200
Ssh!

1310
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,900
Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.

1311
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,800
Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?

1312
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:16,000
We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city

1313
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,000
somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.

1314
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,200
We willbe coordinating
a rigorous investigation.

1315
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:28,300
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene

1316
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,400
- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.

1317
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,200
Back to you in the studio.

1318
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,600
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1319
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,900
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1320
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,900
What the fuck did you guys do?

1321
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:53,000
Arson investigators
are on the premises...

1322
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:01,000
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1323
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:09,200
The victory in the war against crime

1324
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,300
will not come overnight.

1325
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:15,800
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1326
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:20,600
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1327
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,500
I gotta take a piss.

1328
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,400
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1329
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,800
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1330
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,900
Bob.

1331
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,600
Project Hope will be a joint effort

1332
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,300
between the police and community leaders.

1333
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:42,500
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1334
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:30,100
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1335
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,100
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1336
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:38,500
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

1337
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,700
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1338
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,300
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

1339
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,900
Look.

1340
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:50,000
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1341
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:53,500
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1342
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:57,200
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1343
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,100
Do not fuck with us.

1344
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,200
Ball check!

1345
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,900
Bob, you're this way.

1346
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,300
Let's go.

1347
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,400
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.

1348
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,400
Hey!

1349
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,600
Yeah!

1350
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,800
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda

1351
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,500
that wouldn't screw to save its species.

1352
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,200
I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers

1353
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,100
and smother those French beaches
I'd neversee.

1354
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,500
I wanted to breathe smoke.

1355
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,200
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1356
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,800
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1357
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,100
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1358
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,100
Yeah.

1359
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,500
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1360
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,900
After you, Mr Durden.

1361
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:34,800
After you.

1362
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,300
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1363
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,500
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1364
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,500
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1365
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,900
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1366
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:08,100
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1367
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:12,300
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1368
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:16,500
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1369
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,800
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1370
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,100
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1371
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,800
Hey, Tyler!

1372
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,100
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1373
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,400
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

1374
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,100
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1375
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,700
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1376
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,300
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1377
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:44,600
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1378
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,100
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1379
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and especially about you and me.

1380
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,300
What is that supposed to mean?

1381
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,600
What are you doing?

1382
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,100
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1383
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,900
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1384
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:07,300
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1385
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:09,700
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1386
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:12,700
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1387
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:16,400
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

1388
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,600
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1389
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,000
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1390
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,400
Jesus Christ!

1391
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,100
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1392
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,200
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1393
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,900
I am sick of all your shit!

1394
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,800
OK, man.

1395
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,900
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1396
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:40,700
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1397
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:45,800
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1398
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,700
What?

1399
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:51,600
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

1400
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:55,200
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1401
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,600
Let go!

1402
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,700
All right. Fine.

1403
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,400
Fine.

1404
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,700
I'd never been in a car accident.

1405
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:05,100
This must have been
what all those people felt like

1406
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:08,300
before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.

1407
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,300
Goddamn!

1408
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,800
We've just had a near-life experience!

1409
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,300
In the world I see,

1410
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:26,200
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1411
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:29,200
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1412
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,300
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1413
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,800
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1414
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:44,200
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1415
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:47,700
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

1416
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,900
of some abandoned superhighway.

1417
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,900
Feel better, champ.

1418
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,300
And then...

1419
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,800
Tyler?

1420
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,000
..Tyler was gone.

1421
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:36,000
Was I asleep?

1422
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,900
Had I slept?

1423
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1424
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,400
The house had become a living thing.

1425
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:49,000
Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.

1426
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,900
So many people moving, the house moved.

1427
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,700
Planet Tyler.

1428
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,700
I had to hug the walls.

1429
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:01,800
Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.

1430
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,600
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1431
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:08,000
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.

1432
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,100
Hang on a second.

1433
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,900
It's under control, sir.

1434
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,000
Where's Tyler?

1435
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1436
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Right... OK.

1437
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,300
I'm all alone.

1438
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,000
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.

1439
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,200
I am Jack's broken heart.

1440
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:00,000
What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.

1441
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:03,900
The second rule is you do not ask questions.

1442
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,100
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1443
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,400
Who are all these people?

1444
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,700
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1445
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,100
Can I come in?

1446
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:27,100
He's not here.

1447
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:29,400
What?

1448
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,900
Tyler isn't here.

1449
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,900
Tyler went away.

1450
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,200
Tyler's gone.

1451
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,300
Get some help!

1452
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,700
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1453
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,000
What happened? What happened?

1454
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,900
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1455
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,100
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1456
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,600
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1457
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,300
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1458
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,700
We had it all worked out, sir.

1459
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:45,700
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1460
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:48,500
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1461
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,200
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1462
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,300
Oh, God!

1463
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:02,600
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1464
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,700
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1465
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,300
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1466
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,200
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1467
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:17,900
- Bury him.
- What?

1468
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,200
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1469
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,000
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1470
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,300
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1471
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,700
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1472
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:31,900
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1473
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:34,900
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1474
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,900
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1475
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,000
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1476
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Now, you listen to me.

1477
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,500
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1478
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,300
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

1479
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:50,100
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1480
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:53,000
I understand.

1481
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:58,400
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

1482
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,400
has a name.

1483
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:03,400
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1484
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,800
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1485
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,100
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1486
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,900
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1487
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,900
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1488
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,500
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1489
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:21,500
Shut up! This is all over with!

1490
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:27,000
Get the fuck out of here.

1491
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:59,000
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1492
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,400
I need to see you...

1493
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:08,700
I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticketstubs, barhopping.

1494
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:13,400
l didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.

1495
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:17,900
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.

1496
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,400
I wish I could help you,

1497
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,700
sir.

1498
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,800
Every city I went to,

1499
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,200
as soon as I set foot off the plane

1500
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,800
I knew a Fight Club was close.

1501
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,500
Hey! Hey!

1502
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,100
Taxi!

1503
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,200
Look at my face. l'm a member.

1504
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,800
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1505
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:47,400
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

1506
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:52,000
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

1507
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,200
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1508
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:02,400
Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.

1509
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:09,300
Was I asleep? Had I slept?

1510
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:11,500
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?

1511
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:15,700
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1512
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:20,000
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1513
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,900
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1514
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:26,900
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?

1515
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:29,900
I was living in a state of perpetual de'ja vu.

1516
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,600
Everywhere I went,

1517
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:34,600
I felt I'd already been there.

1518
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,500
It was like following an invisible man.

1519
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,500
The smell of dried blood,

1520
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:44,000
dirty, bare footprints circling each other.

1521
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:47,900
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.

1522
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,400
The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.

1523
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,000
I was always just one step behind Tyler.

1524
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:00,800
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1525
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,200
Welcome back, sir.

1526
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:10,200
How have you been?

1527
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,400
Do you know me?

1528
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,700
Is this a test, sir?

1529
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:16,600
No. This is not a test.

1530
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:18,800
You were in here last Thursday.

1531
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:21,600
Thursday?

1532
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:25,500
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1533
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,100
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1534
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,700
Who do you think I am?

1535
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:35,200
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1536
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,200
No, this is not a test.

1537
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,200
You're Mr Durden.

1538
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:43,100
You're the one who gave me this.

1539
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:47,300
Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.

1540
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:00,100
- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.

1541
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,100
- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?

1542
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:03,400
Had sex?

1543
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,700
What kind of stupid question is that?

1544
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,000
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1545
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,600
- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...

1546
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:14,500
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1547
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,800
- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?

1548
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,600
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1549
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,500
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1550
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:26,300
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1551
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,900
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1552
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,000
We just lost cabin pressure.

1553
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,400
What did you just say?

1554
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,800
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1555
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:38,400
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1556
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,500
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1557
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,300
You broke your promise.

1558
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,300
Jesus, Tyler.

1559
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:48,700
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1560
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:52,100
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1561
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,300
Why do people think that I'm you?

1562
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,900
Answer me!

1563
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,900
Sit.

1564
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,200
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1565
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,300
I think you know.

1566
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,900
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1567
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:13,700
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1568
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:16,500
I... I don't know.

1569
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:23,800
- You got it.
- No.

1570
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,900
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1571
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:29,100
Because...

1572
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:31,500
Say it!

1573
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,200
Because we're the same person.

1574
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,300
That's right.

1575
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,400
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.

1576
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:43,100
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1577
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,100
You could not do this on your own.

1578
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,100
All the ways you wish you could be,

1579
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,100
that's me.

1580
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:52,200
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1581
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,500
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1582
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:57,200
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1583
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,200
Oh, no.

1584
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:01,200
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1585
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,500
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1586
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,500
People do it every day.

1587
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:09,100
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1588
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:12,200
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1589
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:19,100
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1590
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:23,800
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1591
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,100
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1592
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:30,500
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

1593
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,100
Tyler Durden.

1594
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:35,900
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

1595
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,200
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1596
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:41,900
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1597
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,500
Or you stay up and make soap.

1598
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:48,500
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. lt's all the same to her.

1599
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Oh, my God.

1600
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,900
Now you see our dilemma.

1601
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,300
She knows too much.

1602
01:49:57,300 --> 01:50:02,400
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1603
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,400
What... What are you saying?

1604
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:09,500
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

1605
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,000
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1606
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,700
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1607
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,200
It's called a changeover.

1608
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:20,400
The movie goes on

1609
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,500
and nobody in the audience has any idea.

1610
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:39,400
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1611
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,800
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1612
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:50,000
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1613
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:59,600
Have I been going to bed earlier everynight?
Have I been sleeping later?

1614
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:04,300
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?

1615
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,000
Is any body here?

1616
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,500
De'ja vu all over again.

1617
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,500
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1618
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,700
Oh, my God.

1619
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,800
- 1888.
- Who am I calling?

1620
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:31,800
1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?

1621
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,300
Hello?

1622
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:36,400
1888 Franklin Street?

1623
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,500
Yes. Can I help you?

1624
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:43,300
- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.

1625
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:45,800
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1626
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,900
- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.

1627
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:51,100
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1628
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,100
It's under control, sir.

1629
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:57,000
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

1630
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,400
2160.

1631
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,100
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1632
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:16,400
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1633
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:20,500
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1634
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:23,100
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1635
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:27,100
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1636
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,900
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1637
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,600
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1638
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,600
You have every right to be...

1639
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,900
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1640
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1641
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:45,900
Why is it free of charge?

1642
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,900
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1643
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,500
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1644
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:55,400
Clean food, please.

1645
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,400
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

1646
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,500
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1647
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:04,100
You got about 30 seconds.

1648
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,100
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1649
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:12,500
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1650
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,500
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

1651
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:21,400
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1652
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,700
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1653
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:26,200
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1654
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,900
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1655
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,200
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1656
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,300
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1657
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:37,600
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1658
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,600
You do?

1659
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,400
I really do.

1660
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:45,800
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1661
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:48,500
Marla, your life is in danger.

1662
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,400
What?

1663
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:54,100
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1664
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,800
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1665
01:53:56,700 --> 01:54:00,200
- No. l've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1666
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,700
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1667
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:08,800
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1668
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:11,700
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

1669
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:13,700
You're spectacular in bed.

1670
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:15,100
But

1671
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:17,100
you're intolerable.

1672
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,600
You have very serious emotional problems.

1673
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:23,600
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1674
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:27,500
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1675
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,600
I can't do this any more.

1676
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,600
I can't.

1677
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,700
And I won't.

1678
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,700
I'm gone.

1679
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:39,400
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1680
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,700
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1681
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:47,200
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1682
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:50,200
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1683
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:52,200
Here, wait right here!

1684
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:58,400
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1685
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,500
Take this money and get on this bus.

1686
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,700
I promise I won't bother you again.

1687
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,100
Shut up!

1688
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:07,300
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1689
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:10,400
Why are you doing this?

1690
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:14,600
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

1691
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:18,800
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

1692
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:23,100
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1693
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:27,300
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1694
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:44,100
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1695
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,900
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1696
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:51,900
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1697
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:55,600
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1698
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:59,300
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1699
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:02,400
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1700
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:07,900
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1701
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:11,600
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1702
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:13,500
That's our headquarters.

1703
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:16,100
In the back, buried in the garden,

1704
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:19,100
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1705
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:22,400
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

1706
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:27,700
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1707
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:29,600
I believe the plan is to blow up

1708
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:32,700
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

1709
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,700
and the TRW building.

1710
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,900
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1711
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:42,500
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1712
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:45,200
You'll create total chaos.

1713
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,800
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

1714
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:02,100
I really admire what you're doing.

1715
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,600
What?

1716
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,600
You're a brave man to order this.

1717
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,400
You're a genius, sir.

1718
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:13,100
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1719
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,300
we gotta get his balls.

1720
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:19,800
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1721
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:22,700
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1722
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:25,600
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1723
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:29,400
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1724
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:32,000
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1725
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,200
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1726
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:45,500
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1727
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,200
Is somebody timing this?

1728
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:51,200
Keep your mouth shut.

1729
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:53,300
Shit!

1730
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:58,500
Some of this information checks out.

1731
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:01,800
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1732
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:04,100
Hey, wait!

1733
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,200
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1734
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:09,700
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1735
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:12,200
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1736
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:18,800
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1737
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Get down on the floor!

1738
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:29,400
The first person
that comes out of this door

1739
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:31,300
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1740
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:57,100
Get away! Stay away!

1741
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,500
I ran.

1742
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:16,100
I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.

1743
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,600
Then I ran some more.

1744
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:01,800
What the fuck are you doing?

1745
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,700
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1746
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:07,800
No. l'm onto you.
l know what's going on here.

1747
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:12,600
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1748
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,200
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1749
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:04,600
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1750
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:07,800
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1751
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:11,100
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1752
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:13,300
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1753
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:15,300
The buildings are empty.

1754
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:18,200
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1755
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:20,800
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1756
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:24,200
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

1757
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:27,800
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1758
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:37,800
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1759
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:39,400
If you know, I know.

1760
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:49,100
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.

1761
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:58,200
You think?

1762
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,100
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1763
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,800
Pull any one but the green one.

1764
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:12,900
I asked you not to do that!

1765
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:16,100
Fuck!

1766
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,100
Tyler, get away from the van.

1767
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:24,500
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1768
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,800
Goddamn it!

1769
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:33,200
OK.

1770
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:36,600
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1771
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:39,200
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1772
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,000
Cool it, Tyler!

1773
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,600
Come on!

1774
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,700
Don't go!

1775
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,800
What?!

1776
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:21,000
Three minutes.

1777
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,300
This is it.

1778
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:26,300
The beginning.

1779
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:28,200
Ground zero.

1780
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,500
I think this is about where we came in.

1781
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:33,000
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1782
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:36,000
I'm sorry?

1783
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I still can't think of anything.

1784
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:42,000
Flashback humor.

1785
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,800
It's getting exciting now.

1786
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,100
Two and a half.

1787
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,600
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1788
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:59,400
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1789
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:03,000
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1790
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:18,300
Why is she here?

1791
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:20,200
Tying up loose ends.

1792
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:23,200
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1793
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:26,300
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

1794
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:29,700
- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.

1795
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:34,400
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1796
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:38,300
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1797
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:40,200
You're a voice in mine!

1798
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:43,100
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1799
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,100
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1800
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:49,400
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1801
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:53,200
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

1802
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:55,000
and I accept that.

1803
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:59,000
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1804
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:02,900
Have I ever let us down?

1805
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:06,600
How far have you come because of me?!

1806
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
I will bring us through this.

1807
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:18,000
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

1808
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:20,300
and in the end you will thank me.

1809
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:23,200
Tyler. Tyler.

1810
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:26,700
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1811
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:29,300
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1812
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:34,600
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1813
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:36,500
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1814
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:41,100
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1815
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,600
60 seconds till CRI.

1816
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,100
No.

1817
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:49,700
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1818
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:53,400
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1819
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:56,600
The gun's in my hand.

1820
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,000
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1821
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:15,000
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1822
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,100
Not my head, Tyler.

1823
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,600
Our head.

1824
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:23,000
Interesting.

1825
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,400
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1826
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:37,500
Hey. It's you and me.

1827
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:42,100
Friends?

1828
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:45,000
Tyler,

1829
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,500
I want you to really listen to me.

1830
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:53,000
OK.

1831
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,900
My eyes are open.

1832
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:14,900
What's that smell?

1833
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:36,600
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1834
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:38,800
Mr Durden!

1835
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:41,500
Oh, my God!

1836
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:49,900
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1837
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:53,700
- Oh, yeah, l'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1838
02:08:53,700 --> 02:08:57,700
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1839
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:00,300
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1840
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:04,000
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1841
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,200
Stop it!

1842
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:11,400
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1843
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:13,100
You!

1844
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:15,200
Hi, Marla.

1845
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:20,400
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1846
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:22,400
Yes, I'm sure.

1847
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,500
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

1848
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:30,100
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

1849
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,600
Yeah, l know.

1850
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:37,900
What happened?

1851
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:40,200
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

1852
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:42,200
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

1853
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

1854
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:51,400
Who did this?

1855
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:53,900
I did, actually.

1856
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:56,000
Find some gauze.

1857
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:59,200
You shot yourself?

1858
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,800
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1859
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:04,100
I'm really OK.

1860
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:08,000
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1861
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:24,100
You met me at a very strange time in my life.

1862
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:05,100
